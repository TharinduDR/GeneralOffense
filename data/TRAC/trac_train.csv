"What the fuck was this? I respect shwetabh and i have been watching his videos
for quite a long time but this review was shit. Nobody wants to watch the
movie for reality or blah. You dont watch movies for inspiration you would
rather read books and biographies. Yes its true that some people are getting
influenced and doing all shitty fuckery but just think. Anyone who takes this
movie seriouslyis already a chutiya. And you dont go to theatre in india for
some reality shit and if u really seek reality and logical scripts and
characters without plotholes and all then you wouldnt be watching kabir singh.
So I think you just made this for views,  
cause theres no need for this so called raw review. And one thing you acted
like u forgot the movie name like seriously you know the whole story and you
pronounced this overhyped mess wrongly? Oh common!!!😂"	NOT

"I literally cannot imagine a scenario where I'd be watching content from this
channel, leave alone penning down a comment. I personally abhor this
propaganda infused right-wing program and have reported it multiple times.
It's in the best interest of the nation if it ceases to exist from the digital
platforms and is confined to television only. Nevertheless, needed to get
certain thoughts off of my chest so here goes:  
1\. Stop broadcasting these staged debates that resemble poorly produced
b-grade flicks at best. The background score during the intro, the
participants who are more like the bickering neighborhood aunties than
dignified panelists, etc. stink of sub-standard nonsense. Stop fooling the
public.  
2\. Instead of all this nonsense, why the hell can't you show how the PM and
Home Minister have successfully confused the nation and are literally behaving
like clueless self-contradicting juveniles?  
3\. With a few days left for 2020, our nation is yet to overcome the confines
of religion. I had high hopes for my country and had started believing that we
would achieve great heights in the field of Science and Technology that would
put us in the big leagues, but no, we are all weighed down by this archaic
concept (read religion) and have ensured that progress is a goal that is quite
far from our reaches.  
A note to Republic TV:  
Instead of showing all this nonsense about anti-nationals, lutyens and what
not please focus on key items that are deterring our nation (unemployment,
poor economy,etc.). The mass does not care about the sub-standard reporting
you do on these ridiculous theories. They want some concrete information that
the news channels alone can provide."	NOT

saw arjun reddy yesterday on amazon and for one i had to pause whenever
character speak bcoz d subtitles were too fast i didnt have time to read the
whole thing.  
Secondly i didnt like arjun ka character- womZaniser, drug addict,
alcoholic.and very abusive.  
Thirdly, by saying i like thia girl in particular clothing and then going from
class to class plus the girl's hostel and giving it the name of love isn't
love at all and it's CREEPY like srk chasing after kajol in DDLJ.  
Fourth point, after repeated pleas by his parents, he still drinks and smokes.  
He was shown in a negative light....but atleast there was a courtroom scene.  
And he is proud to say that while he was high none of his patients died?
Seriously?  
He slapped a girl when it wasnt expected at all. He was very regressive. Not
only regressive but spoilt, unapoligetoc and obnoxious.  
One time watch but yet inspite all this i could see the effort made by the
makers.

firmly believe the male character in Kabir Singh was irresponsible and doesn't
have any reflection with real life or practicality. As you said in the later
part of this video, ""if you're in relationship and your partner is self
derogating then run as fast as possible."" Don't you think this line defy your
Joker analysis, where you appraised/empathize Joker's mental state and called
the movie INCREDIBLE. But in this part you said to run ftom such type of
person, if we all keep running from person who're mentally ill then were would
our generation will end up. I'm not saying this all because I like Kabir
Singh, I'm saying this because I have depression, anxiety and personality
disorder. In the movie ""principal"" told the class about his Anger management
issue.
Kabir also has emotional/mental issues but I guess you didn't observed him
precisely as much as you observed Joker. As per WHO, one in every 20 Indian
suffer from depression; 5 out of 100.

who are still deprived of their basic needs. Do you think, this is the time
such exercise would be of any beneficial to India? Don't you think the CJI and
GOI has wasted our huge 16K Cr rupees in this unsuccessful exercise and if we
live the money aside, look at the extent of trouble and pain people went in
Assam due to this.  
The reason I Pointed to NRC is because NPR is nothing but Opening Step of NRC
and with reference to Scroll.in(correct me if I am wrong) the new questions
added to NPR are indicators of the NRC exclusion process.  
You being a Journalist and from Assam, doesn't this pinches your heart and
raises alarm. Is there no value of human life on this land anymore?  
  
I strongly Oppose NRC, Oppose CAA amendment in the current situation.  
Was there any effective effort from GOI to stop the infiltration?  
  
GOI is just find ways to treat us like goats every now and then.  
  
I know, this questions should be thrown at GOI, however, as I see you a so
called representative of the GOI most of the time, so, I am throwing this on
you.  
Moreover, whats wrong with you getting stuck in this stupid debates on who
told what. Everyone around us promote lies everyday. Nobody really bothers
that anymore. Starting from PM to HM to Activist everyone promotes lies
everywhere but no facts. So, Arundhati is no different, where we cannot trust
the PM/CJI for that matter, who is Arundhati in that league. No one cares
about her. I stopped watching your channel, just thought of looking over today
for a change, but nothing changed. Same insensitive arguments and false
narratives. I wish I could say alternate narratives, but I see them clearly to
be false.  
Also JFYI, I supported the change in Govt, but really regretting now. I dont
support any political party anymore. So, please dont ask me why didn't I speak
during UPA rule. I dont have to answer that to you."	NOT

"You have gone beyond limits this time Pratik. You should not talk about
feminism and liberalism when you have no idea of what it is! I am surprised
beyond anything to see the comments supporting your views and number of
followers you have.  
  
Below are the points where feminists or a person of any gender with even a bit
of a common sense are hurt-  
1\. When the lead actress is never asked if she loves kabir in the movie.  
According to you, in our culture women are not supposed to be asked? You can
just impose whatever you like on her?  
2\. Forcing somebody for intercourse using a knife is a crime in our country,
let alone the question of feminism in that scene.  
  
And for your kind information, liberals are not only the ones you mentioned.
For example, I am pretty sure that you consider Nathuram Godse a hero for
killing father of the nation, mahatma gandhi. In such case, you ll as well be
considered liberal and so was Nathuram Godse.  
  
So don't go on spreading insanity you naive person. Just read more and expand
your logical boundaries."	OFF

"no one is homosexual by birth, their is no scientific or genetic proof. :) it
arises when people get tired of the natural process. And this is basically
because of the arising pornography and vulgarity that is openly viewed and
displayed and majority are prone to it so when they grow tired of the nature,
they tend to find pleasure in something that goes against nature. So we need
to support good and decent content on media and promote early marriages to
abstain from this taboo. And ofcourse this homosexuality is a sign of the day
of judgement as we Muslims believe so we need to seek forgiveness and thank
Allah for His blessings.

prevent this injustice from continuing. We haven't been able to stop it, but

"Simple the film is showing that they are also women who like flawed abusive
men. Have we not seen these women even in our own families? Father is abusive
but Mother keeps quiet and lives by him regardless because she loves him.
Actually the love of the women here is far more than the men. In this film the
female character she see Gabir beyond his flaw that’s what the film is about.
That’s why we need to see love beyond flaws. so Gabir Singh with with all his
flawed character there was a women who still liked him. That’s why some people
liked it.  
  
There were already many films like this already made in Tamil films over the
last decade the idea was to appeal the audience with a male dominated
character to show how an angry person who lives a gal madly and has changed
over the time. The only film that showed this very sensibly was acted by Surya
in the film Mohabbat Ke Dushman another film was acted by Vikram in Tamil film
called Sethu which was redone in Hindi by Salman Khan in Tere Naam. Gabir
Singh is actually a rip off from these Two characters nothing more also the
female characters was also rip off from the female characters from these two
films who were timid characters. So here you go the director got the idea of
writing Arjun Reddy from these two films."	NOT

"Homosexuality : is it natural ?[困]

Not to condemn no people, but to reclaim the fallen from this practice, is
believing that you can be changed from that stage into a better stage ,to say
that we will leave this one off & take the other, who are we to pass that kind
of judgment on our brothers & sisters .

The Question that should be asked is,
where did this perversion of this deviation come about ?

Cause when God created this universe & everything in this universe to obey Him
& His law , the sun obeys the law under which it is created ,the moon ,the
stars , this planet earth obeys the law of its creation. and what we see in
the creation is no ,creature deviates from the law under which it is created.
The planet moves in its orbit not disobeying the law not even , one fraction
of a second & astronomers can bear this witness .

i dont care where you find, an ant , a bee , a fowl , a fish. They all obey
the nature in which they are created, men is not created to deviate from a
certain nature in which he is created.

the planet earth is created to incline to the plain of its orbit 23°c ,30
minutes ,The planet inclines to the plain of its orbit, this is a natural
inclination or leaning.

Man by nature is inclined towards the female & the female by nature leans
towards the man.

Now i want to know ,where did this , deviation come from?

it was not until a man that was made years ago ,from the original man ,made
opposite to the nature of the natural man, made to deviate from the natural
way of God & man ,made an opposser of the natural way & deviates from the
natural course, His whole life style will be a deviation.

The Bible clearly says ,he changed the ""TRUTH"" of God into a lie & when you
pervert the truth of God & make it a lie ,than what follows from that is a
system of perversion of deviation. we didn't have brothers in Africa walking
around with broken wrists .

since people were taught and learned of this behavior we can un-learn this
behavior.

Scripture says ""as a man thinketh so is he "" if you make a man to think like a
woman ,We have seen that ""Thought"" is so powerful it projects itself totally
on the man's brain & it begins to reshape the material so that a man ,who
thinks like a woman , his face, his features, his movements everything about
him begins to change according to his thoughts.

So scripture says "" behold I the sovereign Lord, make all things new"" so we
must get ride of the deviation and bring man back into the natural order in
which he is created & the only way to do that is to place in mans brain a new
thought & that new thought will bring up a new idea and that new idea will
reshape the ""matter"" of the man ,change the form of the man & change the
expression of the man.

There is no such thing as a homosexual that cannot be changed ,there is no
such thing as a ""lesbian"" that cannot be changed, God is here to change us all
up ,into a new growth & bring us back to the natural order in which we were
created."	NOT

According to indian constitution we have three genders and homosexuality is
legal in India so if someone is saying NO to homosexuality or transgenders
this means they are not obeying the indian constitution.  
  
I was NCC cadet and when we are in NCC we get a news that army officers or
soldiers sometimes they sexually abuse to girlish or an innocent I am the
witness I saw this and heard during the NCC period.  
Next I have made physical relationship with men who were or still they are
working with defence forces. So no one can come forward and say that in
defence we have no homosexual. There are but they are in closet.  
Second there are many news where soldiers abused or physically harassed girls
so no one can say that if homosexual will join defence so they will tease the
or harass the straight soldiers.  
  
Homosexual people are normal they are not prostitute who need Sex all the
time.  
  
Please don’t respect transgender and homosexual people if you don’t want

I hope you all get my message well.  
Last year in April I have arranged for my sister's wedding. We all were happy
and had provided some gifts in the form of money and material to (as per their
demand) bridegroom's. After few days of marriage she was beaten by her husband
and in laws for dowry. We tried many times very carefully because we are from
Brahmin society and we can't break marriage. Then after we gone to many times
police action and other things but when we go for these actions they become
innocent and after few days they again start doing beating and torture to my
sister. One day she told ""Bhaiya if I will stay few more day, I will die
because of their torture and painless beat"". Then I have decided to go for
police and justice. We have lodged FIR after so many resistance of police. We
have almost 10-12 wandered for FIR. In May 2017 finally FIR done. But then
police took lot of money from them. Police didn't took single action against
them so that they can feel guilty about their did.  
  
HOW CAN ANYONE SAY POLICE WILL TAKE ACTION SERIOUSLY? NOW POLICE HAS MORE
CHANCE TO DO CURRUPTION.

3\. Telling the girl of your dreams that I will kiss your mother and sister  
  
4\. Making her stay at a guys' hostel, apparently out of the care for her  
  
5\. Boasting about the fact that he had alcohol every time before he performed
the more than 500 surgeries, without a single one going awry!

liberal is not true  
. Things like nudity and stuff. Indigenous tribe who live naked doesn't know
anything. So i dont expect you to tell me what to wear.

start questioning vedas you will find it just a book written by prosperous
people to control the entire community. How can u relate Mathematics with
vedas? Pls dont tell me calculus was invented by vedas.

written after indus valley civilization. And zero was in use in Nile Valley
Civilizations too. I can't say who used it first.

save me although i dont believe in god.

conservative नहीं कह सकता आपकी liberal वाली defination से मै खुद को liberal भी

the screen space in movies from the inception of movies and gotten away with
projected as heroic and manly for molesting, suppress or objectifying women,
let our leading ladies have the fun!! Or else let wrong be wrong , no matter
which sex it comes from and stay neutral rather than justifying a male
character and further inflating male ego and their superiority complex!! But
on a more serious note I don’t think every liberals or feminists comes from a
place of hating men just like how every conservative does not come from a
place of hating women!! Let night he ideologies be used where they are
needed!! Why do people have to be so rigid, timid and regressive as well as

coin. And I'm pretty sure that if this was a girl's story the girls would be
defending and ladko ki jalti buri wali. Anyway, I don't morally judge, and you
are absolutely right in your review. It's a good film with raw and well shaped
characters and i appreciate their effort. 🙂"	NOT

"Hello Pratik,  
You have said in multiple videos about the importance of having an opinion and
the right to express that. Now an opinion depends on different thoughts,
situations,beliefs,background,relationships,experiences etc on a very personal
level. Difference on every aspect of life is the beautiful essence of the very
existence of human being. I, personally agree with many of your thoughts but
at the same time dont agree with some opinions. My question is why is it so
important to put a tag or lebelize the ones who have different thoughts or
dont agree with yours point of view? Why does everybody (who dont share the
opinions as yours) have to be a 'feminazi', 'liberal' etc? Dont you think we
should be respectful and polite to viewers ( more so because we are all
educated and well read people) in a public domain? Aggression is good when
applied cleverly and certainly not in unidimensional rage.

"Hii Pratik ji...I really liked your video and I too agree to your perspective.
I watched the movie today and I don't feel that it's anyway hurting 'the so-
called feminist ego'. Instead the entire movie is all about acknowledging the
character Kabir's issues, faults mistakes, failures and his unconditional love
for Preeti. The culmination of the movie speaks for itself.. wherein a changed
Kabir, fully in realisation of his blunders finally meets his love of his life
Preeti, who is Not The Victim but the final and true saviour of Kabir. I
really don't support the so-called feminism which is now seen hovering in the
air. Instead I support true feminism--equality for both the sexes, male as
well as female without any kind of discrimination on any ground. Also,
negative values are negative for everyone.. Irrespective of men and women."	NOT

life... who bring down everyone around them because of a break up. i think
showing why the character is like this... delving deeper into his anger
issues, his insecurities would be a better movie... jab dekho love love
love... kya bakwas...ask any psychiatrist and they will tell you this is some
kind of personality disorder. thats what people are talking about... stop
blaming feminism all the time to justify weirdos.

"Homosexuality is prohibited in almost every major religion. So we should not
follow western culture(even banned in Christianity).  
Our creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can
only get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big
misconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's
genes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be
genetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a
gay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of
nature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind
later gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries
earlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who
fulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had
multiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started
getting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor
he will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven
that having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout
your life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us
a better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments.
So homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it
in India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their
opposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a
mindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy
psychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just
to complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the
rules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue
our sexual and spiritual life.  
At last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the
Truth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be
legal in India on behalf of their democracy. Nothing is bigger than the Nature
given laws and the Truth of life.

move on from someone whom he truly loved. They are separated because of the
prevailing stereotypes. Sandeep Reddy Vanga has studied psychology himself,
and he beautifully presented a story about a brilliant and intelligent
surgeon’s downfall and his resurgence. The scene where he doesn’t want to
plead not guilty because his professionalism is the only thing his father
respected about him is very emotional and brings out the good nature of
Kabir/Arjun.

dealing with consequences of lost love. It does not actually 'promote'
anything. It's simply a story and its better to see a fiction as a fiction. I
personally love both his and Sucharita's review but like I loved Sucharita's
review on Mard ko dard nahi hota and I hated his review about Kedarnath.

they see in movies and blaming Bollywood is wrong.Movies and shows have a

1973,it had such a cultural impact.There is a documentary made on it.People
flocked in theaters to watch that film only because it got word of mouth
publicity for being the scariest movie of it's [time.It](http://time.it/) was
banned in several places but people still took buses to watch the movie in the
next town.The show 'Game Of Thrones', 'Breaking Bad' and 'Dexter' had a lot of
impact on people.They have fan clubs for superhero movies.A lot of people were
committing murders after watching 'Dexter' series.'Gone Girl' inspired a lot
of people to commit similar crimes.'Titanic' had that same effect on people
who were gushing over 'Jack & Rose' romance.K-Pop and K-drama has forced a lot
of women around the world to believe in fairytale romance and they are all
travelling to Korea to find a Korean bf/husband.Japanese manga and anime has a
huge cultural impact on people around the [world.So](http://world.so/),I
personally believe that you are being a little too harsh on Indians for loving
Bollywood.Most Indians are middle class or lower middle class people who are
struggling in their daily life.Sometimes reality is very harsh so they watch
these over the top movies to escape their reality.I do agree that these
cliched romance movies are very misleading and men and women both fall for

"Totally agreed with your practicality but there are many subtle things that
actually shows how bad the character is and how he suffers for that. You
actually said a lot of things wrong:  
1\. He understands how wrong his attitude is  
2\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this
shows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude  
3\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the
end he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend,
girl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised.  
4\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts
shows how his relation with father changed.  
5\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup.
He never does that even though he is unable to move on  
6\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A
man who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his
personality and attitude, its a very big positive change.  
7\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but
the scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without
anything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the
relationship was very bollywood typical though)  
8\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know
about it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person
is fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive
relationship.  
9\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after
removing her heavy bag.  
10\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when
he was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am
sorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship
here.  
11\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned
if he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble
background would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don
biography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he
had to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example
!  
12\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that
he took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take
advantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also
shown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl
for long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed.  
13\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be
what is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic
flawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative.  
14\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist
actually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs
(hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong
but he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?)  
15\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very
typical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go
into a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to
hurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what
hookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental
desparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then?  
  
Please feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews
are as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir.  
Ps. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man
todays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And
sex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood. Kabir singh dint sell dumb
sex atlst and is a masterpiece for acting skills. Maybe watch Vijaya
dervakonda in arjun reddy. Takes a lot of effort to get in the shoes of those
villain charecters, should appreciate that before calling it garbage. Ranvir
was great actor since his charecter lost in padmavati but shahid is shit

of his character and ultimately idolized him , if it ended in a tragic way and
showed the results of his flawed actions , it could be called a ""Character
Study"" . To say the truth Kabir Singh is an absolute idiot who has no control
over his life. On the other hand movie like ""Taxi Driver"" actually exposes
effect of loneliness , frustation of repressed masculinity , toxic outburst
and most importantly effect of his actions i.e. his girlfriend leaves him and
his attempt to commit suicide, moreover it's not shown as a love story."	NOT

"@smart prabudh dixit the problem with ""Indians"" is that they are very
emotional people. When a kid in his teens sees one of these so called
""romantic bollywood films"", it is bound to play with his mind.  
  
In this scenario, i certainly won't blame the directors or producers, because
I'm sure they may have great scripts, but the audience in India is such that
they dont want to see that. They don't support it, they dont like it. They
want to see that typical ""mirchi masala"" movie and they dont want to think
beyond that. In such a situation, the cinema industry has no option but to
comply with them.  
  
I think its high time we open up our narrow thinking. I saw Joker yesterday,
and oh boy was that a masterpiece. I find it hard to believe that we dont have
such brilliant ideas, but bringing it to the big screens is the biggest

a chance to better projects. Kudos!"	NOT

"What people don't realize is that if Kabir Singh made you feel uncomfortable,
it was supposed to. It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and
now Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different
kind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist
who's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey
rather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his
perspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right,
wronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the
same basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the
movie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That
it's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny.  
  
  
Throughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost
feeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by
his self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this
torment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues
till the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any
kind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn
by finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't
find anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way
glorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and
repulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his
lifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as
a person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering
misogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message
instead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You
literally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting
characters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while
trying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact
a very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed
man, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch-
black. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a
positive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the
rock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at
his lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered
a personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the
choice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for
eternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus
the film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of
its runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life.  
  
For all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said
earlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and
technical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience.  
  
  
I wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with
an open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially
since this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to
distort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when
they are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like
Arjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society.

accusations, lgbtq rights, mard ko dard nahi hota crap? You just bashed  
two communities because of the behaviour of some of its members which is
exactly what you accused them to do. You are a hypocrite. You are influencing
a huge amount of people what you just did was spread hatred. Did you know
feminist actually means the equality of the sexes not manhating as you said?
As for the review if you call slapping each other, bashing your partner's
family, not being able to confront you dad about forcing you into marriage
with another guy after becoming an independent woman(a doctor!) , forcing a
girl on knife point to show her body, drugs, smoking and drinking excessively
because you cannot deal with a breakup, performing surgury while intoxicated a
heroic romance then god bless you. God save you.

"Actually this movie is different because..in other Bollywood romantic movies
hero fights with 100 villains for heroine..or heroine's father is the villain
who hires a gang who will beat hero and then hero will fight and prove his
love...kabir singh is at least different in this case...and Kabir singh is
rude and short tempered..that's his fault and director portrayed the impact in
movie..and the suffering is also portrayed..this movie does not influence boys
to do whatever Kabir singh does...if anybody gets inspired..then he will be
also inspired to kill people by only playing PUBG
And one more thing it is at least better than those shitty Bollywood movies in
which hero fights villains without any weapons(like he is superman).at least
something is different from the previous Bollywood romantic movie trend..
please support that.and you are talking about the behaviour of a real human
being is not portrayed? Who stays confused in his life? I think you have not
seen the movie till the last minute..Kabir Singh who was rude from the first
he also cries at a time when everything was going out of his hand..so it shows
hero gained some lesson from his past and audience should take this as lesson
from the movie.

"I'm not Trying to be Feminist or So-called Liberal but Cinema influence
Youth... I don't say dark character should not be shown in movies but showing

The problem with kabir singh is not with the negativity of the character, but
with the people buying into the negativity. People are proclaiming him the
HERO and is glorifying him as an inspiration!  
Kabir treated Peeeti as his Toy, his 'Bandi'. Kabir at no point asks preeti
for her consent regarding his forcing her to be into relationship with him,
which can mislead many men too, even lots of girls will find it cute too..  
Imagine a Kabir Singh in your Life!!!  
My Problem is not with the movie or character but the character is so real
that it can lead to birth of so many Kabir Singh in real life which is
regressive to the society..  
The character is celebrated as a romantic lead which is dangerous if subjected
to real life, people are finding his actions , his abuse, hus anger cool.. his
negativity is celebrated but thats really wrong.. his character is so real
that it can provoke men in our country...  
Kabir Singh is a masterpiece, Acting is Fabulous, but In reality I don't
support such person, but today's youth especially boys will consider this cool
& heroic which is a threat..

good movie. If a women is shown drinking then it is very bad and against
cultural values but if kabir singh is shown as a drinker and smoker then we
should be proud of the movie. Kabir singh is threatening everybody that preeti
is my lady, nobody should come close to her and thats a morally right thing
acc. to you. Wow, what hypocrisy. I know the movie is about negative side of
kabir singh but unfortunately this side of kabir singh has been highlighted in
a very stylished misogynistic way. In this film one thing is clearly shown
that women should like and look for dominating and possessive lovers. If same
role will be based on a women then u will obviously have problems, you will
see it as a unculturable and non traditional thing. Why women should always be
shown in submissive roles. 99% of movies in india are based on male point of
view but if 1% of movies are based on female point of view, their liberties,
why everybody has problem in that. This is true hypocrisy. Atlast i want to

"Bro you should watch that movie again just to clear some facts. When Kabir
meets Preeti in the end, she tells her about her residence in some hostel and
she worked in a clinic. Movies are not always meant to connect them with
reality and teach us lessons ( I admit some movies do that). Some are meant to
enjoy. The movie shows an excellent chemistry between two guys with some mind
blowing romantic songs, how much more do you expect from it bro? Nothing is
perfect bro.  
As you said person should ideally move on immediately after break up (in one
of the videos you said in a slang way that, “khat khat move on karna chahiye
mard ko""), I am with you bro. But it would take 3-4 months for a guy and it’s
normal. Kabir Singh here takes his time say 7-8months (not too much for even a
fictional story), and then they marry. He developed smoking and drinking habit
but even in that time he worked. Yeah one thing you exaggerated about medical
students (they didn’t get time of all this). I being a medico can say that we
get time for our relationships and we also live as a social animal. (I am not
proving you wrong but you just exaggerated the fact)."	NOT

"All those feminists who are criticising the film did not understand at all the
meaning of the film. Nowhere did the director tried to justify Kabir Singh or
tried to portray him as a great human being. It's the story of a flawed
character, his downfall to the path of self destruction and final redemption.
Actually for me it's quite an inspiring story. We all have inner flaws and
demons within us and are constantly fighting with them. Kabir Singh became a
victim of his inner demons which led to his downfall. But its inspiring to see
his final redemption after controlling all his inner demons.  
So I request all feminists to have some basic knowledge about films before
trying to criticize. They should watch the Oscar Winning film of Robert de
Niro 'Raging Bull' before judging Kabir Singh.  
As usual a fantastic video by you Pratik ji and by your sound reasoning u have

"The contemporary feminist lives such a comfortable life that she has the time
to complain about such trivial nonsense like manspreading and movie characters
being a little too masculine. And if she wanted to, she would make a video
about the movie, degrade it to the point that people would stop watching it
not caring about the hard work the creators put for it and a female host of
her channel would laugh about it and so would their audience. But I’m the one
who is sexist if I complain about it because according to feminist theory, I’m
privileged and the power structure gives advantages to men. What advantages?
They can’t say. And because of this power structure, sexism towards men
doesn’t exist. According to feminism, I am so privileged that I don’t even
have the right to talk about gender issues. All of my opinions are
automatically invalid because I’m a man. I am a man – I am evil, I am
disposable, I am privileged.  
The thing is, I actually do care about gender equality. I would gladly point
out real sexism when I see it being done against women, something which the
new wave feminists bafflingly neglect to do when it’s being perpetuated by
anyone. But feminists don’t return the favour. Their narrative is that I am
the cause of all the world’s problems and I have to be the one to change, to
make sacrifices and give more and more to them because of this imaginary
bogeyman called the “Patriarchy” which they claim gives me all the systemic
advantages in society. The concept of a patriarchy is essential to their
ideology and this core makes the ideology paint me as the oppressor and the
villain and I’m sick of it. I’m not a catcaller, I’m not a wife beater, and
I’m not a rapist. But I’m held accountable for the actions of the few men who
do these things and that’s bullshit. And it’s exactly the type of bullshit
being perpetuated by several social media sites and YouTube channels - the
idea that men are the problem, that we should be ashamed of what we are and
that masculinity is toxic and needs to be stamped out. Feminist may claim that
they don’t hate men but actions speak louder than words. If you call yourself
a feminist but if you agree that all of the things that I talked about are
wrong, then you need to stop calling yourself a feminist. You don’t need to
call yourself a feminist to be an advocate for equality. Feminism doesn’t hold
a monopoly on that as much as they like to think they do. And if you truly
value equality, you will drop the feminist label and stop trying to defend it
because it is – destructive, divisive, counter-intuitive, and predicated on
lies and misinformation. Feminism is bullshit and it is unworthy of respect."	OFF

abusing drugs is so fake. And in reality if people start abusing drugs than
they'll become so unattractive bcoz reality will slap them so hardly and those
drugs would make you go bald, loose those muscles, loose ur charm, loose ur
social life, make you a failure in ur career and you won't even get that
respect as Kabir singh got in the movie)

in a way validating them. But the way you have tried to explain it, i want
every viewer to take a note of this. That kabir singh is an imperfect human
and we should realize every bad habit of his as bad and good traits of him
should be appreciated too. Considering him so great, publicising him as a
macho dude is in a way whitewashing every wrong thing in him and due to this i
was very uncomfirtable. I cant see the youth taking inspiration from this and
getting into drinking or drugs. There was no liberal or feminist agenda behind
it. So not everthing is about liberalism or feminism."	OFF

"Seems like you have also watched Sucharita's review !  
However, as a female I would have certainly wanted the lead actress to have
bit stronger character. But critically speaking, this movie is solely based on
an individual's story. The name itself is Kabir Singh. Secondly, we have seen
such rowdy and complicated female characters in Hindi Movies, just like
Tannu's character.  
Now without taking any sides, I would like to state that movies should be
watched critically, and should never have emotional connection if we want to
review.  
And I agree with your review and your explanation of the movie.  
This time I honestly watched the movie before watching any reviews. And it's a
good movie with good character development. Good story line. And it's a story
of an individual.  
This movie is solely meant for commercial success. And I am also not happy
about the over critical feminist reviews.  
Thanks a lot for this review."	NOT

positively and provide feedback. There are many things wrong with this movie
like kabir Singh marks preeti as his territory without asking her, are we all
guys not taught to ask girls out properly. There are many guys who think it's
okay to act this way, because preeti did not have a problem. But what if a
girl says no, guys will take on their ego and harass a girl till she says Yes.
I have sisters who faced this. This sends out a very wrong message, and guys
learn it indirectly. That's why everyone is fighting for it. There are a lot
of things wrong with other movies too, but Lets not take that and defend this
movie. Lets pinpoint stuff if anything is wrong to get better content which
can be entertaining."	OFF

influenced by movies more than anything else. So if a movie is trying to
promote negativity in society subliminally or openly it needs to be called out
and criticised openly. Some will say ""Oh it is just a film."" But many people
DO take these movies seriously and it does affect as well as change their
lives. So though I disagree with Pratik regarding some movies, I hugely
respect what he does. Filmmakers should not be allowed to create whatever
bullshit they want to manipulate minds of youths, simply in the name of
artistic freedom!"	OFF
