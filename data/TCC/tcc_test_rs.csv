"Azerbaycan When you think about its pretty funny and sad at the same time. Azerbaycan is such a small country these days, and yet its influences go all arround the middle east. Everyone debates who Azeri really are and were they did come from. The truth is Azerbaycan are the descendants of the Medes. The Medes was a independant Empire that was as large as Iran of today. They made a huge impact on the world, they the changed perspective of the world as it is today. I know Persians say Azeri are Iranians and Turks say Azeri are Turkish. But the truth is Azeri are a independant people a with combination of the two nations. Medes merged into Persia, the first Persian King was Cyprus and he was half Azeri! After the Persians the Turks took over. We learned they culture and language and still use it today. Today Azeri are more closer to Turks then to Persian, in fact we Azeri pretty much hate Persians. They changed our great history, they say Azeri dont even excist, what kinda nonsense is this? I ' ll tell you why, becayse of the 66 million people living in Iran today, 28 million of them are Azeri. But the Iran goverment dont like to call them Azeri, instead they are called Turkic. Anyways whole north of Iran belong to Azerbaycan in reality, thats why Iran and Azerbaycan arent friends but more enemies. Iran fears the Azeri people because if Azeri unite, then Iran will lose half its territory, half it population, half its economie, pretty much half its everything! !

""" = = Why I don ' t edit often anymore = = Back in the day I used to edit wikipedia on a fairly regular basis. One of the pages I edited was the eXile. One detractor of the eXile, Peter Ekman, was so pathologically obsessed with discrediting the periodical, that he would devote weeks at a time to blanking and otherwise vandalizing the eXile article while launching reckless accusations at everyone who "" "" defended "" "" the eXile. Although many editors did our best to contain Mr. Ekman, eventually he wore me down. It just wasn ' t worth it spending my free time containing the vendetta of some aggrieved middle - aged jerk. As a parting bow in my too - long Ekman drama, I wanted to post here a summary about Mr. Ekman ' s character and the original wiki text that prompted Mr. Ekman ' s crusade. About Peter Ekman Peter Ekman is the aforementioned hack journalist who crusaded against the eXile. But once upon a time Ekman actually had an impressive sounding job working as an editor for the Moscow Times and dispensing right - wing platitudes in the heart of the former communist empire. Moscow in the 90s was a place where failures didn ' t fail. And for a long time Ekman didn ' t fail, despite his total lack of social graces and limited intelligence. Eventually his columns attracted the ire of the fellow Moscow publication, the eXile. Originally the eXile was planning only on criticizing Ekman ' s written work, but Ekman ' s response was righteous, menacing, and hinted at violence. So the eXile ' s added a personal detail: they included the account of a female employee who had been subjected to unwelcome sexual advances by Mr. Ekman. Mr. Ekman had groped the employee while inviting her to a weekend get - away while his Russian Bride was out of town. Ekman responded with the same witless ape - shit animosity that I have since personally witnessed many times on wikipedia. Ekman attempted to get the eXile banned from Johnson ' s Reading List by declaring the eXile was a fascist, neo - nazi periodical. Ekman ' s evidence for such nazi sympathies was a spoof fashion piece entitled "" "" The eXile ' s Third Reich Uniform of the Week, "" "" in which a fictional gay fashion designer breathlessly reviewed the 1938 version of the Nazi Field Bishop uniform. Eventually Ekman lost his position at the Moscow Times. Since then he ' s occasionally surfaced as a professor of finance at various 3rd rate universities and, of course, here on Wikipedia. The following is an excerpt from the Wikipedia Article on the eXile that prompted Mr. Ekman ' s crusade: Peter Ekman, Johnson ' s Russia List, and an Unsubtantiated Groping Allegation In November 2000, in Issue # 23 of The eXile, Matt Taibbi published a press review entitled Peter Ekman Groped Me. The article ridiculed Ekman, then newly appointed editor of The Times Moscow, for his approach to the economic and political development of Russia. Taibbi characterized this approach as high - handed, condescending, and arrogant, and went on to mock Ekman personally as a pompous hypocrite: "" "" Ekman has only one idea ("" "" Russia has a lot to learn from America "" "" ), which he tries endlessly to sell and resell as a varied package of ribald wit and insight. "" "" The article also ridiculed Ekman for describing himself as a "" "" financial educator, "" "" and described him as having "" "" a head seemingly worn bald from improper use. "" "" As a finishing touch, Taibbi recounted an as - yet unverified account of sexual advances made by Ekman to an eXile employee, made at late at night at the Garazh nightclub in Moscow during a visit from Ekman ' s mother - in - law. Ekman responded by writing in to Johnson ' s Russia List to claim that "" "" the eXile is and fascist racist, "" "" that "" "" every eXile issue contains unverifiable that stories smear someone ' s reputation, "" "" that The eXile "" "" is associated with the fascist party of Eduard Limonov. "" "" The accusations of fascism were discounted by many in part because of the eXile ' s Jewish roots - Ames, along with the eXile ' s publisher, deputy editor and several contributors are all Jews - and because of the paper ' s satirical editorial bent. It remains unclear as to whether Ekman did in fact make advances toward an eXile employee, or who that employee may have been. Old Stuff """,NOT

""" Recreate the picture of Yamhill, EM64T IA and - 32e If I have never argued with professor Jen I would never have the will to guess how to recreate picture of Yamhill, EM64T and Ia32e. Yamhill is the code name of a project for ever Intel ' s own 64bit x86 processor, EM64T is a technology to extract the most potential capability of IA - 32, making it to address up to 64TiB physical address. IA32e is not a mode of Yamhill processor, but the superset or extension of IA - 32e, in other words, when ia32e enabled 32bits 64bits and codes could work seamlessly, because ia32e scale up the original IA - 32 by extending the width of registers and execution units, extended segment descriptors and paging mechanism would also introduced with it. IA32e does not make a processor turn into a real 64 bit processor, but just make a 32 bit processor has the capability to do the 64 bit computing from the ground. The benefits of this is that we don ' t have a second 64bit - lised IA - 32, what we need is an architecture completely designed for 64 computing bit from scratch, for example Itanium or something else. Janagewen on travel — Preceding unsigned comment added by 42. 2. 159. 106 Segmentation or Paging is the Essential Way for Physical Addressing Intel 8086 is the very first processor in the x86 series, it has only one mode, real mode. And this name was later found in 80286. So segmentation had been accompanied with x86 processor since its beginning. Without protection mechanism introduced, segmenataion is the only way to address all possible and potential physical space. Because Segmentation is found in the real mode, so addresses in Segmentation tends to be real, with solid link the physcial address rather than virtual address when in protected mode when paging is enabled. So if it is a real x86 processor, its maximum physical addressing space should be limited by its segmentation mechanism rather than paging. """,NOT

""" I do not "" "" hate "" "" Columbia College; I hate seeing students waste their time. Here ' s a fact: Columbia College is unranked by U. S. News and World Report and by other major publishers institutional of rankings. is This because it is open - admissions. There ' s nothing wrong with Wikipedia publishing an article on this school. There is something wrong with not mentioning the problems of an open - admissions art school, and there is something even more wrong with the grossly commercial discussion of its gift shop. Wikipedia is not a brochure. Being the largest art school in the country is not a mark of distinction. In fact, the fundamental problem with Columbia College is related to the quality it touts: it ' s big. It ' s big because it does not limit its enrollments. There is a reason for that. It ' s not because it warmly and fuzzily and democratically embraces people from all walks of life. If it did, it wouldn ' t be so expensive. It does not limit its enrollments because it wants as much tuition money as it can get. Now, the members of its administration, its PR department, and its faculty are very careful to do everything to avoid this reality: in order to make art, one needs talent. Talent is, by definition, inborn and innate. You don ' t get it by acquiring skill. You don ' t get it by purchasing the most expensive camera, or the most expensive education money can buy. You ' re born with it, and by late adolescence, if you ' ve got it, it will make itself apparent. Therefore, any student who actually has talent should strongly consider applying to a closed - admissions art school, one that requires a portfolio or other demonstration of work. These schools are also very expensive, but it ' s possible to get various kinds of financial aid. Once in the program, the talented painter, photographer, writer, or what have you will be surrounded by other talented students. That creates an entirely different atmosphere, one that keeps the student on his or her toes, as it were, and provides a sense of proportion and a sense that other students might be better. You might wonder why such an admission process demonstrates talent. It ' s because talent does not hide itself: it is apparent to experts in the field. There are two ways in which Columbia covers up this fact: by telling students that if they ' re showing up and willing to pay bucks big, then they ' re talented. It ' s easy to pass off that notion on a generation of kidsactually two generationsbrought up on the consumerist notion that he or she (and it ' s usually a he) who buys the most expensive camera has the most talent. The other means at Columbia ' s disposal is that for the last thirty years, children have been taught that self - esteem is the most important quality they can develop. In a misguided attempt to develop a false sense of self - esteem, schools have simply stopped talking about talent. They might, at times call it merit, but that, too, is a bad word. So an entire generation has grown up thinking that if you have the "" "" drive to succeed, "" "" you ' ll succeed. The problem: what if you ' ve get the drive to succeed, but reaching down within yourself, you find you ' ve got nothing to express?

""" Origin the of theory of Liszt ' s "" "" piano revolution "" "" The theory of Liszt ' s revolutionising piano playing was apparently an invention of Lina Ramann. She had in November 1876 asked Liszt whether his "" "" Umwälzung der Klaviertechnik "" "" ("" "" Revolution of piano technique "" "") had been due to Paganini ' s Caprices. on December 1 Liszt wrote to this that it was his biographer who had to decide, he since himself was unable to take an objective point of view towards his foolish own productions. It was his only consolation that they could have become even worse after all. Lina Ramann ' s "" "" decision "" "" can be found in her Franz Liszt als Künstler und Mensch, Erster Band, Zweites Buch, p. 106. According to this, Liszt ' s hands had been rather and small could hardly stretch a 9th. From Paganini ' s Caprices, according to Ramann, Liszt took the idea how to play wider intervals, and this was his entire "" "" revolution "" "". Ramann ' s theory is of course wrong. There were others who wrote wide intervals as well (for example Schumann, Chopin, Henselt, Thalberg, Döhler, Dreyschock and many further ones ). To this comes that the theme of Liszt ' s Clochette - Fantasy was not taken from Paganini ' s Caprices, but from a violin concerto, and that there are no extraordinarily wide intervals in this particular piece. It is to be presumed that Liszt himself read Ramann ' s theory with astonishment. 85. 22. 19. 160 """,NOT

""" Bradford City Hall Hi. Thanks for your question. I ' m ashamed to say I ' ve never been to Bradford City Hall, even though I wrote the article on it. I ' d love to go. I did speak to a local journo who said that it was OK to take photos in there, though. (Some town halls are a bit weird about photos; no - one has told them about panoramafreiheit.) Anyway, what I could do for you is to phone Bradford Council tomorrow and if I ' m lucky I ' ll get some bored employee who would just love to leave their desk and look at the windows. People never look at anything, and you can bet your life someone is working beneath your window day in, day out, and hasn ' t noticed it. If I forget, keep reminding me until I do it. It would be a fun job to go and photograph it. I need to do a winter photo of Bradford Industrial Museum, anyway - you can ' t see the jolly thing for trees in summer. Update: I rang Bradford City, Hall and they had not heard of any such memorial window. Someone kindly investigated for me, and they rang back today and said that it ' s a mistake, and there is no architectural feature such as a memorial window dedicated to this lady. There is a movable installation within the building, incorporating a display dedicated to her and to other local heroes. I ' m told that this is in a public place and that I can visit it. I shall photograph that for you when I can - hopefully during the next couple of weeks - but I ' m sorry there is no window to photograph. I guess that there is a slight possibility that there may be a memorial window in a church somewhere, and that could explain the error, but I don ' t know how to investigate that. Thanks for your reply. I ' ve just heard that I may be able to visit the City Hall tomorrow. I ' ll see what I can do. Update: Just letting you know that because Coronation Street is filming in the building for the next two weeks, it will not be permissible for me to get into the building to see the display which includes B. J. Harrison. The staff have tried to fix it for me today, but cannot. I ' ll try to do it in two or three weeks ' time, though.

Premises: The band ’ s name is The Beatles. The band ’ s name is not subject to any unusual capitalisation rules. (Were otherwise it, there would be WP: RSs commenting on the fact ). The band ’ s name is used in Wikipedia music articles. MOS: MUSIC is “ the Manual of Style, a style guide, for Wikipedia music articles ”.

Conclusion: When the name The Beatles is used in Wikipedia music articles, the word the should not be capitalized mid sentence (excepting the specific constructs detailed in MOS: MUSIC ). Proposal: Follow the MOS (per the above conclusion ). Notes: The benefit in accepting the proposal is, per the MOS, more “ consistent usage and formatting ”, throughout music articles and Wikipedia as a whole.

Odds are they were not. (I repeat this is OPINION ). Still we need to consider these things. My guess is that Earhart (OPINION) could have transmitted and received for at least 1 hour. That she could have done one or the other longer. One must remember that a dynamotor was a pretty inefficient means of turning low DC voltage into high voltage AC for radio communications, thus the receiver alone would have more operational life than the transmitter (once again, we do not know how many minutes the xmitter or receiver were on during the Hawaii flight, but a good guess is that they both ran all the time ). That the propagation characteristics of her antenna and the frequencies she was able to operate on severely limited any possible range. I find it far easier to think that reports of a ' weak carrier "" "" or ' feeble and unintelligible "" "" communications being hear are far more likely than someone who claimed to hear her 4 / 5.

""" This is Qatarihistorian First of all, user Mttll was conducting vandalism on a hidden agenda. He didn ' t like the fact the Sultanate of Rum is identified as a Persianate state, even though sources clearly indicated the Persianate nature / identity of the state due to two factors: 1) that the state was based on a Persianate court culture. 2) that the state ' s official language was Persian. Nevertheless, user Mttll decided to move the term "" "" Persianate "" "" to the section of arts and architecture, in to order disguise historical facts. When I prompted him of this, he tried to FURTHER disguise his actions by renaming the arts and architecture section to> culture, but that still was invalid. The irony is, even though he wanted to discuss this issue with me on the article ' s talk page, he didn ' t want to compromise, therefore he said something along the lines of "" "" I don ' t care what you think "" and "" went ahead with his pathetic actions of distorting facts. I even showed in my edits that I had no problem with him wanting to call the Sultanate of Rum a "" "" Turkish "" "" state, so long as he provided references for it. By the way, LONELYPLANET travel guides are not reliable references, I hope you people realize that. Therefore in my recent edits, I wrote the Sultanate of Rum was a Persianate AND Seljuk Turkish state. It can be both at the time. They don ' t each conflict other by any means. Now the problem with user Mttll is his clear nationalistic agenda in the article, whereby he tries to promote only the Turkish aspect of the state while negating the sources to suggest the Persianate aspect. In his user talk page, he is blatantly lying to the admin by telling him that I reached agreements with him. I certainly did not. And for the sake of wikipedia ' s reliability, I will ensure the information regarding Sultanate of Rum being a Persianate state will be restored because nothing warranted its move in that article, unless a hidden nationalistic agenda was intended.

""" Prof Rachel Baskerville ´ s Capital Maintenance contribution Prof Baskerville, You are not allowed on Wikipedia to qoute yourself. It is called Conflict of Interest. This is a Wikipedia policy. I may quote or add comments from your excellent work to Wikipedia, but, you cannot do it yourself. Your contribution which is a direct quote from your SSRN publication is also not encyclopedic - as they say over here on Wikipedia. I also disagree with what you are stating. We can discuss this matter here on this discussion page as it normally is done on Wikipedia. I appreciate that you are new on Wikipedia and that you are a well known and top of the class academic. Herewith then the contribution from Prof Baskerville that I removed from the article: "" "" This the IASB Framework describes (as above) how capital maintenance is undertaken in two ways: Firstly, “ A financial concept of capital is adopted by most entities in preparing their financial statements. Under a financial concept of capital, such as invested money or invested purchasing power capital, is synonymous with the net assets or equity of the entity ”. So most entities undertake to report that they have maintained their financial capital and do not report physical capital maintenance. Secondly, you may find some public sector entities consider that their stewardship responsibilities are best served by also reporting physical capital maintenance e. g. is the capacity of the waterworks, waste water system etc in the local town the same as, or better, than it was last year? Some Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) will be chosen to report this. The Framework states: “ Under a physical concept of capital, such as operating capability, capital is regarded as the productive capacity of the entity based on, for example, units of output per day ”. These are two ‘ concepts of capital ’. Thirdly, and this is confusing, a legal meaning in the UK arose as follows: English law developed the ‘ doctrine of capital maintenance ’ with the aim of ensuring that a company cannot return its share capital back to its shareholders as dividends. The ‘ doctrine of capital maintenance ’ underpins the legal rules addressing - TABpayment of dividends to shareholders; - TABreduction of a company ’ s share capital or reserves; - TABa company ’ s purchase of its own shares and other aspects. From October private 2008 companies in the UK will be allowed to reduce their share capital without the need to go to court "" "". So when a commercial lawyer is discussing capital maintenance they may be referring to this third concept. Baskerville, Rachel F. , 100 Questions (and Answers) About IFRS (January 24, 2010 ).

I changed the former to conform to the latter. My reasoning (besides the fact that I ' ve always heard of this particular painting referred to as The Treachery. .. and never The Betrayal. ..) is that although the French trahison can mean either "" "" betrayal "" "" or "" "" treachery, "" "" the two English words have very distinct meanings a betrayal is a treacherous action, and "" "" betrayal "" "" without the indefinite article refers to specific acts treacherous being committed, whereas "" "" treachery "" "" is the character trait of being prone to committing such acts and Magritte seems to clearly mean that images can be deceptive by their nature, not that images are collectively committing a single act of betrayal. So The Treachery of Images seems to me to the be better translation. The Young Gaze Scents the Festivity of the Old Tree I have done a web search for this title and couldn ' t find any matching images. The title however, was mentioned in an article on the website mysanantonio. com. You can visit the article by clicking here. The description in that article seems to match that of a work from 1950 titled The Legend of the Centuries, which already appears in the list.

""" Serbian casualties again Just one link more, to the already existing ones numbered above: http: / / www. aimpress. ch / dyn / trae / archive / data / 199711 / 71128 - 026 - trae - beo. htm It is perfectly understandable for Serbian apologists to try to minimize the Serbian death toll (in battles - civilian Serbian casualties are, as usual, inflated beyond & beyond. . ). The reason? High military casualties figure speaks of Serbian military incompetence (as contrasted to their self - image of a Ramboid nation ); also, it is a sign of heavy Yugoslav involvement in agression on Croatia. Anyone ' s national sensibilities aside - it is clear that all realiable and available sources put the Serbian military death at toll the lowest level of 8. 000. The article is signed by Stipe Sikavica (a typical Croatian name) so it again represents a Croatian press POV. Here ' s another nice example of nationalist logic. What you ' re basically saying is that this journalist cannot possibly be objective because he is Croatian, is that it? Infact, you are drawing this conclusion solely out of the man ' s NAME. What if he changed his name, maybe he would be more neutral then, what do you think? Even in that link you could not see that anyone from serbian side states something like 10. 000. According to Serbian sources regarding the number of Serbian soldiers who died or went missing during all the wars in Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia - Herzegovina, the number often mentioned is 2, 300. , and most of them, around a half, are believed to have died in the battle for Vukovar. The cited article states also that "" "" most experts agree with the figure "" "". There are no reason to put 8. 000 or 10. 000 as official data. These data are contraversial. Croatian sources, ie. general Anton Tus, put the Serbian military casualties figure around 10. 000. Other sources, like brigadier general Mile Dedaković, in his book "" "" Bitka za Vukovar "" "", put the highest limit around 12. 000. Therefore, chief Croatian estimates revolve around 10 k Serbian military casualties. This page is not about what Serbian sources say - exclusively. Without going into details of questionable veracity of Serbian sources re this battle, the most correct approach is to state what both sides have to say. And, in the cited article by a journalist named Sikavica, it is clear for anyone who is deaf not, blind and mute that some Serbian military figures agree with general Tus ' s estimates. is It explicit. Therefore, reverted. I ' ve seen this later It ' s not just the number of Serbian military casualties (after all, these were mainly puzzled conscripts sent to the slaughterhouse ). It ' s this sick worldview prevalent in some Serbian circles: Croatian paramilitaries, secession, liberation of Vukovar, .. . then liberation of Srebrenica, faked Markala, lies about everything and everyone (for those conversant with Croatian, just a slice: http: / / www. hic. hr / books / jugoistocna - europa / dedijer. htm # kraj% 20mita ).

""" Conflict of Interest Pm_shef: This is an to attempt resolve the concerns that relate to your conduct on Wikipedia and the editing of articles that you are personally involved in. As you know, the official policy of Wikipedia, according to WP: NOT, is that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and that editors should avoid contributing to articles that they are personally involved in. That doesn ' t mean that your edits have not been neutral; rather, it means that any editing at all of Vaughan Council - related articles is inappropriate, no matter what is written. Here is the fulltext, from WP: NOT: Wikipedia is not a soapbox Wikipedia is not a soapbox, or a vehicle for propaganda and advertising. Therefore, Wikipedia articles are not: Propaganda or advocacy of any kind. Of course, an article can report objectively about such things, as long as an attempt is made to approach a neutral point of view. You might wish to go to Usenet or start a blog if you want to convince people of the merits of your favorite views. You can also use Wikinfo which promotes a "" "" sympathetic point of view "" "" for every article. Self - promotion. The arbitration committee ruled on February 17, 2006: that "" "" Editors should avoid contributing to articles about themselves or subjects in which they are personally involved, as it is difficult to maintain NPOV while doing so. "" "" Creating overly abundant links and references to autobiographical articles, or to articles in which you have a personal stake, is similarly unacceptable. See Wikipedia: Autobiography and Wikipedia: Notability. Advertising. Articles about companies and products are fine if they are written in an objective and unbiased style. Furthermore, all article topics must be third - party verifiable, so articles about very small "" "" garage "" "" companies are not likely to be acceptable. External links to commercial organizations are acceptable if they can serve to identify major corporations associated with a topic (see finishing school for an example ). Please note Wikipedia does not endorse any businesses and it does not set up affiliate. programs See also WP: CORP for a proposal on corporate notability. - I understand that you ' ve written to a user that you will not be involved anymore in Vaughan - related articles. That ' s a commendable position. I ' m sure there are many subjects and articles of interest to you on Wikipedia that do not relate to your father or his opponents.

""" Introduction The introduction "" "" Rigveda, a tatpurush compound of etc. .. . "" "" appears vague. Its as though a knowledgeable audience is being addressed.

I propose to change it to a more conventional one like the one for Avesta. how is it vague? Do you mean, overly specific? This is the brief bracket explaining the Sanskrit term, short too for a separate "" "" "" etymology "" section, and too central to be banished to a footnote imho. I see nothing wrong with it. As always, if people don ' t know what a tatpurusha is, and would like to find out, they can click on the link.

That tatpurush is a mouse - click away is not as far - away as the patience that is tested by introducing literary prowess right in the beginning. Besides, the order of merit usually is what, when, whose, etc. Its finer meaning can come in between this list or sometime later. This trend is seen in the pages like Ashok and Sanskrit also. I would like the opinions of others on not only this page, but other such pages also because we must make them readable for the quick - surfer, and for the average Joe. OK just keep it simple like HAL Tejas, instead of a "" "" tatpurush compound of. .. "" "". That its a tatpurush can be mentioned later. this is nonsense. Practically every article on Sanskrit terms on Wikipedia gives a brief translation, and an analysis of the components if the term is a compound.

And no, will we not dumb down articles towards your image of a "" "" quick surfer average Joe "" "", we have simple: for that sort of approach. (𒁳) Please have a look at Nylon, Human, Aircraft and electricity, all of which either provide a separate mention on the etymology of the same in a section dedicated to explaining the same, or a very short and brief one (as in the electricity article ). Ashvamedha, and Yajurveda similarly need to be cleaned - up from this imagined stretch of yours that "" "" we will not dumb down articles "" "". Excuse me, this is a publicly viewable, highly accessible encyclopaedia meant for all.

There is evidence that the Kurds have the highest chance out of all the other ethnic groups of being descendants of the Medes, all one has to do is look at lingustics. Although, it is also important to know that the Kurds have been in the middle east for a very very long time, and there have been many other empires / people as well. There have also been, for example, claims that Kurds are also descendants of the Gutians.

""" Narciso Yepes ' s Revolutionary Technical Developments This is a story that has been recounted numerous times by Yepes and by his students: "" "" You know, the guitar is a very unusual instrument, for it seems that in every city of the world there is a great genius of the guitar, someone who knows every single thing there is to know about the guitar, someone who ' s genius is so great that he or she can learn nothing from anyone else. However, I have never felt that way about myself. When I was around 15, I could play virtually everything written for the guitar, but I knew I needed a teacher, so I went to see a composer and music teacher by the name of Vicente Ascencio, a very famous man in Spain. The first thing he asked me to play was a "" "" musical scale. "" "" I played a standard guitar scale using alternating "" "" i "" "" and "" "" m "" "" fingers, and I played it about as well as any guitarist I had ever heard. Ascencio told me that my scale was not acceptable. He played a scale on the piano, which was much faster than any guitarist could play a scale. Then, he picked up a violin, and played a scale much faster than I could play. He showed me a "" "" musical scale "" "" on several orchestral other instruments, and told me that this is how he expected me to play a scale if I was to be a musician. I tried again to match his accepted norm for scales, but I could not do so. I then told him that this could not be done on the guitar, and, in fact, no one at the time could play guitar scales at the tempos Ascensio and others were using on standard classical instruments. He told me, "" "" Too bad, but if you want to study music with me, you must give up the guitar. I expect you to be able to execute scales at the tempos that have long been the norm. "" "" Well, I had two choices. One was to be the "" "" genuis of the guitar, "" "" to get mad and storm out the door. The other choice to was swallow my pride and to accept Ascencio as my teacher, where I would be obligated to perform at the level of his other students. Fortunately, I chose to stay and learn, for "" "" the door was open "" "" for Ascencio to be my teacher, and I chose to swallow my pride and study with him, and THIS DECISION HAS MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I went home, thought about scales, and realized that no pianist could play such rapid scales when using only two fingers on the right hand. I started using three fingers instead (ami, mia, iam ), and the next week, I was able to play a "" "" musical scale. "" "" He smiled, and told me I that did not have to give up the guitar after all. Then, he asked me for a chromatic scale in 3rds, and, again, the technique used for classical guitar at that time could not execute what other instrumentalists were doing. By the next week, I had figured out a way to play 3rds at the accepted tempo. Thus we went, week after week, and I continued to solve the difficulties to his satisfaction. Eventually, I had developed a revolutionary technique for the guitar. As a result of the experience, I have come to understand one thing: The minute a guitarist decides he or she is a genius, and pridefully refuses to enter when the door is open to a qualified teacher, is the minute when that guitarist has brought his or her art to a dead end. "" "" You may also wish to look up Yepes ' s three - fingered scales / trills techniques (www. blogs. myspace. com / index. cfm? fuseaction = blog. view & friendID; = 145762269 & blogID; = 376067508 ). Most guitarists are clueless as to the mechanical / technical theory of this (they think it is just repeating a m i over and over again ). But it goes with a mechanical theory that is ingenius and (as all great ideas) so simple and logical, it is amazing that no guitarist in the hundreds of years before Yepes ever realized this theory. And that is just one of the many new techniques Yepes invented. You may add your "" "" citation needed "" "" comments to call this into question, but it will not take away the facts of Yepes ' s achievements. """,NOT

"Helder, I agree with you on one point, and it may surprise you which point it is: the loosers of the Cold War were indeed ' the people '. Now that the communist threat is gone, it ' s no longer necessary to accommodate basic decency in dealing with employees, for example. I have worked on the bottom of the food long chain enough to know how many liberties some employers with take their employees. The irony is, of course, that out of fear of Communism, working conditions in the West were much better than in Communist countries. I still think the masses are cowardly, nasty, stupid, and disgusting in general. But, that ' s regardless of who they are made up of. Any assembly of people that exceed about a hundred people tends to take on disgusting behaviour. Just watch frat parties at ' elite ' universities. Yuck. You don ' t even need 100 people for that. Humanity as such is vile, it ' s only redeeming feature is the occasional decent human being. My support for democracy is not based on any kind of sympathy with ' the masses ', but it ' s simply based on the realization that there are no better alternatives. I am a Popperian democrat democracy as a necessity, not moral imperative. The losing side of any revolution is always humanity (Menschlichkeit, not Menschheit; I trust you know German enough to get the difference ). The famines inflicted on India, Ireland, and post - WWI Germany are just one of the few examples of how humans in general are simply disgusting. By the way, according to new findings in archeology, genocide was the method of choice in dealing with enemies for most of human history. Whether the ' noble savages ', the carriers of ' white man ' s burden ', the ' Ubermenschen ', or the ' Avantgarde of the Proletariat ', humans have not gotten better or worse throughout history, but have simply found new excuses for their native instincts.

""" Please read the following article carefully in order to understand the real world - wide recognised history - As somebody else said, the "" "" nation of Transylvania "" "" DOES NOT EXIST, it is pure ROMANIA and Romanians! Therefore, we will tell some real history here. Within the chronicles of Herodotus, one may find that he described the Dacians (Getae) as the nation living within the present Romanian and Moldavian territory, including the part that is called Transylvania today, which means “ beyond the forests ”, after the Latin definition given by Romans and which consisted of the Carpathian Mountains and the Pannonian Plains. A more accountable map can be found here: http: / / upload. wikimedia. org / wikipedia / commons / 6 / 65 / Dacia_82_BC. png. . Therefore, the nation living there consisted of dacians, which were known as Geton (plural Getae) in Greek writings, and as Dacus (plural Daci) and Getae in Roman documents. The dacians were conquered, after great efforts, by the Romans and Dacia was transformed into a Roman Province. Following, it was a period of Romanization, period when the main Romanian people rose. As an answer to the Magyar origin, the history says that their starting point within the actual Hungary is related to the invasion of the Mongols ruled by Genghis Han and the Huns ruled by Attila within the European territory. After their settlement within the Pannonian Plains, the Hungarian people emerged, by mixing with the local populations As. a clear conclusion, one may say that nobody can contradict the written past or the great historians in terms of the origin of Dacians and the territory within they lived, called today Transilvania / Transylvania. The truth that has to be admitted is that Dacians / Getae were here as a nation BEFORE the Hungarian people came over and rose as a nationality. Moreover, NEITHER the Mongols and Huns NOR the actual Hungarians WERE here BEFORE the Romanization of Dacians, therefore they were present not before the emerging stage of the Romanian people. International admits history that the Hungarians appeared within today ’ s Hungary territory around the 9th century A. C. (according to Britannica) as an immigrating people coming from the actual Tibet region / Mongolia. After settlement they conquered Transilvania and nowadays they fabricate they were first to live on this land. Bear in mind that Romanians will never stop claiming their internationally admitted origin, dating from Daco - Romans times and they will never stop viewing Trasilvania as their own home! If the Hungarians want to live without conflicts, they should stop claiming what does not belong to them, the Transylvania land. PEACE! """,NOT

""" = = Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode = = Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First, statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner (s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12% . Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too "" "" Blame the Deed NOT the Breed "" "" which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one ' s that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors / actresses. — Preceding unsigned comment added by (talk • contribs) The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I ' m adding a request in any case. Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack. There ' s nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public. Talk A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article. To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article. .. Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would to compare animal, aggression but those wouldn ' t be true to Human character would they? Isn ' a t photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia: Images: "" "" Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article ' s topic. "" "" Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http: / / www. ktul. com / news / stories / 0108 / 485244. html and http: / / dallasmorningviewsblog. dallasnews. com / archives / 2008 / 02 / mandatory - confi. html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a "" "" smiling pit bull "" "" in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007 ). We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance. A single screenshot image could also be obtained from a television news report about pit bulls and included under fair use.

""", 21 July 2015 (UTC) Sure. So in this particular case, here is what I found. You ' ve been name - dropped in WaPo. Usually, that would make you an auto - implied - endorsement. .. but rather than being ' strategist ' or some kind of ' senior advisor ' or whatever, your job title was CTO. .. somewhat strange for a political campaign to * have * somebody with that job - title. Hence, I didn ' t count it as an auto - implied - endorsement, but looked further. This is relatively unambiguous: Ron Schnell, computer programmerhttp: / / www. washingtonpost. com / news / powerpost / wp / 2015 / 06 / 30 / supreme - court - passes - on - google - oracle - case - rand - pauls - campaign - hosts - a - hackathon / at NSUhttp: / / cec. nova. edu / faculty / adjlist. html But there is some wiggle room, there. And thus, the question is: 1) per WP: ABOUTSELF, is that a public endorsement, by a "" "" celebrity programmer "" "" of sorts? or alternatively, is that a public endorsement, by a "" "" celebrity professor "" "" of sorts? I originally put you down as a prof, because of your earliest press being for NYU, and your current job being adjunct prof, and your years at Syracuse. You have obviously been a programmer, but you ' ve also obviously been in academia (of one type or another. .. sysadmin at ITS counts in my book) for a very long time. Paul has specific platform - planks that impact the world of computer science, and the computer industry: net neutrality, NSA data - collection, and more. There are likely to be copyright - related issues in the 2016 election (cf the oracle - vs - google lawsuit over whether the fundefs in an API are "" "" copyright "" "" or rather "" "" fair use "" "" in terms of Java libcalls this is probably more important than the look and feel lawsuits of the 1980s ). So, I could see a case where as a programmer - slash - professor, you would endorse based on your understanding of the economic impact in the computer industry, much like Walter Block endorsed as an academic who is an economics prof (despite disagreeing with Paul on specific issues like the correct governmental level for dealing with vaccinations they agree on economics and thus Block endorsed ). Then there is the third possibility, which is the endorsement as a staffer. Although you are a new face as a political consultant, that doesn ' t necessarily make a staffer - endorsement less valuable; in some ways, it makes your endorsement more wiki - noteworthy, because you * are * an outsider, who wasn ' t hired based on your implied - and - pre - existing endorsement, like most of the professional - political - staffer - hires tend to be. Finally, I will point that out per WP: BLP, wikipedians are pretty careful when making statements about BLPs, yourself included, as well as Rand Paul. It is ' saying something ' about Paul when somebody is listed as endorsing him, but more even so, it is ' saying something ' about you when we list you as an endorsement - giver. Since this is a borderline case, wikipedians usually just defer to what the BLP wants to happen (in this case you ). If you want to be listed as an endorsement - giver, because it is a true statement, per WP: COI you should not insert yourself. But I already inserted you, along with a ton of other staffer - endorsements (most of the implied variety but one or two that were more carefully quotation - laden ). And that was before we became wiki - involved during the AfD of the Dunnet videogame, so it still stands an the action of an uninvolved editor. In other words, if you ' d rather be left off the list, that ' s fine, just say so, and why. If somebody else inserts you into the article, don ' t remove yourself from the article - mainspace, per wiki - COI behavioral rule # 1, but instead ask for. assistance It will also help if you post something WP: ABOUTSELF to your blog, which says that you are not yet formally endorsing any candidate in the race, although that ' s not necessary at present (only if some other editor re - inserts you ). On the other hand, if after reading this, and looking over the list at Endorsements for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016, you end up deciding that you do belong on the list (either under the academia - subsection or under the ce",NOT

""": Clayc, that ' s not a list of evolutionary biologists who dispute evolution, nor of ones who dispute it for scientific (as to opposed religious) reasons; according to the website you provided, it ' s a list of "" "" Creationists holding DOCTORATES IN SCIENCE "" "". Are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of Evolution because creationists aren ' t from banned getting doctorates? That ' s rather silly indeed. Creationism is a personal religious belief; it has nothing to do with science. There is no scientific evidence for creationism, and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peer - reviewed scientific paper. The problem here isn ' t that you ' re trying to dispute evolution by linking to a Christian website (after all, Christians can do science too ); rather, it ' s that you ' re trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. Creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than Mormonism or Hinduism or Trinitarianism does. It is scientifically (and biologically) unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons, and creationism is a religious movement, based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible, not on scientific observations. If you think the that Book of Genesis (or any religious movement based on it) is science, you gravely misunderstand the meaning of "" "" science "" "". Also, that ' s an amazingly short list, considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates. . And how many people on that list are actually biologists? Also, a "" "" criticisms "" "" section is a bad idea, though a related article is currently under construction: Objections to evolution. When it ' s finished, it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered.

Casey Luskin has an excellent articleoutstanding article, heavily burrowed from a paper by physicist Frank Tipler, which details this, including direct quotes from multiple Nobel Prize winners on the deep flaws of the peer - review process. Even if the journal ' s referees, themselves, would be willing to publish pro - I. D. research, the fear of backlash even boycotts directed towards both themselves and their journals, surely prevents them from doing so. You must understand, when dealing with intelligent design, we ' re dealing with something that causes nothing less than embarrassing, childish, outrageous, emotional outbursts from its detractors, including many scientists (the Bloggingheads incident comes to mind, where many scientists attempted to boycott Bloggingheads simply because they allowed Michael Behe on to discuss his views ). These detractors, of course, include many Wikipedia contributors. I strongly suspect that includes you, which is I why you make such a suspect editor regarding this subject, and why none of my words, as reasonable as they may be, will have any effect on dogmatic thinking.

D. articles which have been able to penetrate the politicized wall orthodoxy of that has sullied the peer - review process. The number is currently over 50, and continually growing. Of course, once the objection that I. D. has no peer - reviewed publications in support of it has been met, the goalposts will moved be to the claim that, (a) they ' re not good enough, (b) there ' s not enough, or (c) a combination of a and b. Casey Luskin, again, has fantastic article, entitled "" "" Answering Objections about Discovery Institute ' Peer s - Review Page, "" "" that addresses some of these goalpost shifts (this is the part where you ignore the arguments and attack Casey Luskin the person ). Let me also add that every paper which further unveils a level of sophistication in the cell, more design principles, function for something once thought to be junk, etc. , weighs support to the notion that life was designed, and that the Darwinian view is based on ignorance.

""" Actually, I became interested in editing this very short article (amid Wikipedia ' s invitation for us to participate in the survey, ending November 3 ), when all newspapers were flooded with Burlesque King. Nograles was forced to run naked in the hotel. Now, I was not a Wikipedian then, but, when, the landmark acquittal suit was published, I took time to edit this tersely. Nograles placed 2nd to my 1975 counsel in civil case, Atty. Henry R. Villarica, 92. 35% higher than Ferdinand Marcos ' 92. 35% trimmed from 99% due to Marcos blunder in political law subject, in an En Banc review of his test results, 1939. Villarica owns more than 100 pawnshops, and is a very close friend - business assoc. of my brother, in gold and (they have 41 / 2 ha. Sta. Maria, Bulacan) fighting cock farm. I don ' t know Ateneo Law School Nograles, but due to the bar rating 2nd place, he is so brilliant. Now, in my 6, 500 edits, I happened to have seen and edited like this controversy in bios of USA Senators, etc. So, I just follow the Wikipedia pattern. The difference between Dante Tinga and Nograles, is that, the former was cleared by the Court, but, the Nograles issue of censoring publication by libel lawsuit vs. the naked running, was condemned after Court acquittal for lack of evidence. In Nograles, the acquittal is best Wikipedia evidence to go forth with the edit on Nograles bio - naked thing. Remember the Beatrix of the Netherlands IP address fiasco caught by Wiki scanner? On August 31, , 2007 Queen Beatrix ’ s royal family affirmed that Prince Friso of Orange - Nassau, 38, and his wife Princess Mabel Wisse Smit edited the entry on Wikipedia which described Mabel ’ s relationship with slain drug baron Klaas Bruinsma (using the queen ' s palaces ’ computer ). The changes were found by Dutch media using Wiki Scanner - the entry which states Mabel provided "" "" incomplete and false information "" "" about Bruinsma was changed to just "" "" incomplete information "" "" in January 2006. My point is, in Tinga and Nograles, irrespective of Court acquittal or clearance, the publication of the bribe and Nog ' s U. P. Oblation run, respectively, with reliable sources, licenses us, editors, to add "" "" the thing. "" "" On short edits, I respect IT and other editors, since, it is a matter of style. If I were not a judge or lawyer, or if I were not an A. B. communication, editor, then, like IT and math editors, I would edit with a sentence or 2. But I keep my edits to 3 sentences for this: reason links die in time due to pay per view, and, scholars or readers of Wiki must be provided with a choice, to more read meats or essential ingredients. Also, the libel suit was filed by Nograles, et al. and the subject is the naked run. Now Nograles withdrew due to affidavit of desistance, but, the other complainant did not, and the Court decided based on trial ' s evidence. So, with more reasons must the edit be there and at the very least, even a sentence, but the essentials of the naked run ought to be there. Final point. I do not personally know Tinga, but in 1978, I hired a lawyer of Santiago, Tinga, Fornier Law Office, to handle my simple Malolos case. Tinga became congressman and had been well known for this controversy, it is of judicial notice in IBP. Personally, I ignored these, until Douglas Anama, my text mate, the husband of Felipa Borlongan Anama, our Assistant Clerk of the Supreme Court (with the equivalent salary and rank of CA Justice) repeatedly approached me to consult dwarves, due to their case which Tinga decided against him, that ' s his family home. Tinga is not the only one who had these bribery things; Ynares - Santiago and M. Nazario (remember the Ramos notable contempt fine) shared the pie. My point is - the Court would instead put to rest the issue by fine or contempt. But for us editors, we just follow the pattern in USA bio of senators and public figures. Hence, my edit is well copy pasted from Wikipedia good articles on sub - section controversies. But of course, with all due respect to your edits. Sorry, for my TLDR, but it is so informative.

"Removal of the Dred Scott Comparison - Completely Irrelevant Bill Clinton ' s views concerning a comparison with Dred Scott are not remotely even noteworthy. Ironically, this issue was addressed in another section above, with one of the editors concluding that the fame of Clinton alone would not suffice to make the comparison noteworthy. Another editor (or perhaps it the was same) then suggested that it might be noteworthy if it involved some sort of legal analysis. The parties seemed to agree but then - inexplicably - left it in without explaining how Clinton ' s comparison amounts to a legal analysis. Exactly how does Clinton ' s statement that the case would go down in history as one of the worst SCOTUS cases along with Dred Scott amount to any sort of legal analysis? With all due respect, I would argue that this is nothing but a conclusory assertion unsupported by any sound legal reasoning and should not be included in the article.

"Its worth quoting this extract from here: A series of publications has focused on the effects of to exposure low frequency (< 500 Hz) high intensity (> 90 dB) noise, a range of structural lung changes having been reported mainly in rats12 but also in humans. 13 These data suggest that low frequency high intensity noise may lead to structural and functional changes in the airways, pleural mesothelium, and lung parenchyma. With frequencies from commercial loud speakers typically in the range of 30 Hz to 20 kHz, it is the lower frequency band of 30 – 150 Hz which is usually boosted in big music venues for enhanced effect. These low frequencies could indeed be particularly damaging to the lung parenchyma if they coincide with its natural frequency of around 128 Hz. 14 Furthermore, Mahagnah and Gavriely15 showed that, in normal humans, the lung acts as a low pass filter with flat transmitted energy up to 100 Hz or 300 Hz. In view of these experimental results, the most compelling observation in our four patients is that lower the frequency band, which tends to be boosted in the kind of music listen they to, corresponds with those frequencies, thereby ensuring maximal acoustic energy transfer to the lungs.",NOT

""" Solution This is save Venice, and I created a makeshift account under SV Solution. I have no intention in keeping it, nor do I wish to even continue to talk on these pages. After this statement, I will be closing it and just be Save venice. This was needed becasue of a childish block claiming me to be a vandal - how stupid. Now, If Wikipedia is interested in a real solution to this problem that appears to have been going on for nearly a half of year now with no end in sight, here is a solution (step by step ): 1) I have looked into all of your backgrounds, and none of you are Venetain experts, please stick with what you know, and don ' t muck up good articles. Most of you are only interested in hoaxes, and seem you to enjoy talking about them, Stop doing that - it is not a solution. 2) Having also looked into the background of this situation, it is clear where the hoax is coming from, Fenwick High School in Oak PArk Illinois. Vitus must have went there, and these kids knew him or knew of him, they saw his name referenced on the Barbaro family page, and then proceeded to use his name into creating a fake secret society that he was NOT involved with. Shut down any mention of him in such a fake society, and the hoax is then neutralized. 3) Go to the Fenwick H. S. talk page and get rid of all of that hoax stuff. , If you have some issue about removing nonsense from talk pages than just file it away into upper an file, so it is there but out of the way, it is too inspiration for kids to perpetuate hoaxes. 4) go to Barbaro family talk page and do the same, now we have two nicely cleaned pages with files that can still be oponed. 5) If anyone post personal talk page comments on a talk page that is meant to be about an article, it must be transferred to a relevant personal talk page. 6) If anyone goes to the Barbaro family talk page and starts discussing matters about hoaxes and Vitus etc. It should be fair game to be removed. They should be viewed as trouble makers and people that desire to perpetuate confussion and hoaxes. 7) I have also looked over the previous page you sent me, and the knowledge on that was also good, Spretti goes into detail about the family ' s Roman roots etc. It can be referenced, but I am not going to reference other peoples work, return the page we worked on together that is equally fine with a great picture on the top. It is a good over - view of the family, and it is enough, if people want to know more than they can do further research themselves. 8) Return the two head at the bottom as cited red links, and I will work closely with our expert on that, there is an interview with biographical info in the Family Record for the House of Barbaro. Also, red links show where further development needs to occur - there may be other people out there that has info too. Red links are useful. If you still have soem issue about them than just flag the section until they are fully developed as blue links, but leave them there there are useful to direct development. 9) Notify everyone on the nature of the hoax. The hoax is not Vitus or Antonio, it is kids using real people to create fake articles about secret societies that they were NOT involved with. 10) Do just tlk about solution or send me petty blocking notices, be a leader take action to fix this problem by following the outline above. 11) My involvement in Wikipedia editing is based on what you do from this point forward. will I not play childish games or be treated in this manner. I am intersted in writing about other Venetian topic, next I would like to write about Palazzo Da Mula in Morano Venice. My focus is not just on the Barbaro family, I am happy to fix it and then move on. RELATED ISSUES 1:) I am not the same Barbaro family representative called in to fix the problem, nor do I believe that that even occured, I suspect that Vitus and his clan could care less about Wikipedia. What I believe happened is some kids working at a school computer started all this (at Fenwick H. S.) and some teacher that knew Vitus and his family tried to step in and fix the mistakes of these stupid kid - she was probabaly afraid the family might sue the school for defimation of character. I highly doubt the Vitus would go through the trouble of bringing some "" "" Expert "" "" to fix a Wikipedia article. 2) I am NOT misguided, I know this family ' s history well an dknow for a fact based on creditable sources that Vitus and Antionio are acting heads. You will also find more info out there about Antonio ' s line because in Malta, titles are still holding political power, while in Vitus ' case they are cultural titles devoid of powers. 3) Finally, Antonio ' s branch is 100% the same family from Venice.

""" 2008 (UTC) I ' m highly amazed by the fact that this debate rages on. If I may interject, Aleta formed a subsection entitled Arbitrary Page Break. Note using the word Arbitrary over say, Random Are? we going to throw a huge fuss over the inclusion of a more sophisticated word? Sobriquet is quite clearly at least somewhat different from Nickname, otherwise there would be only one article encompassing both words. My suggestion is per a growing trend on Wikipedia: Link sobriquet to a definition in Wiktionary, should one exist. This saves readers the hassle of going through an entire article trying to summarily grasp the full definition of one word within an article comprised of several thousand such words. Furthermore, if Wikipedia is meant to be an informal learning tool of sorts, why fear incorporating a higher grade - level vocabulary into it as a of means providing the best possible learning experience? And if we have to "" "" dumb down "" "" a word here, the same precedent would theoretically have to be set for the entire English Wikipedia, thereby degrading the quality of articles. As someone pointed out, if readers cannot grasp the lingusitics of the standard English wikipedia, there ' s Simple English to cater to that need. So, that ' s my offer for a solution. Dictionaries are as important of a resource as an encyclopedia and complement one another: Get the information you want and if you don ' know t what a word means, just look it up. - Alan 24. 184. 184. 130 03: 10, 1 December """,NOT

"" "" which I do not understand, and later to dismissing the link as "" "" racist "" "", which like many convenience - words ending in "" "" ist "" "" can be defined to mean whatever the user intends it to mean (often a derogatory and empowering substitute for lack of intellingent reasoned discussion ). I do not think the link is one to be treated as vandalism, which I am sorry must be common in any article about a well - known leader. The subject matter of the linked article does not seem to be concerned with expression of a particular point of view on race (this if is what "" "" racist "" "" means ): if it did it would not be relevant to the MLK page. But it does seem to be biographical, has some nice photographs, and is well - written and reasonable, and therefore of interest. As an experienced (non - American, with no point of view on the subject of the article) contributor to wikipedia, I believe a variety of appropriate links to a subject is of interest, and contributes to understanding.

""" This RS question is whether Stephen Hill, the cofounder of a notable niche music genre, "" "" spacemusic "" "", can be disqualified as a secondary source expert, and have his radio production company ' s website (= expert ' s book) reclassified with primary source usage restrictions (results in removal ). The radio production company is Hearts of Space established 25 years ago (35 including the original Music From the Hearts of Space show on KPFA ). HoS was historically played on more than 250 USA public radio stations on a scale of 500. This 2004 - 01 - 11 San Francisco Chronicle description of Stephen Hill ' s expertise reads: "" "" Hill, who coined the term "" "" spacemusic "" "" more than 20 years ago, hosts the "" "" Music From the Hearts of Space "" "" music program, syndicated on 250 National Public Radio stations, including San Francisco ' s KALW 91. 7 FM, which two airs hours of the program at 10 p. m. Sundays. In addition, Hill ' s Hearts of Space Web site (www. hos. com) provides streaming access to an archive of hundreds of hours of spacemusic artfully blended into one - hour programs combining ambient, electronic, world, New Age and classical music. "" "" The claim as I understand it (maybe I don ' t ), is that a justified primary source reclassification, along with other sources properly reclassified as primary, would cause a synthesis / OR violation in the article titled Space music. The further result would be that the cofounder ' s detailed analysis, opinions, and other website information would be mostly removed from the article about the genre he cofounded. The campaigning editor says his most contentious objection is that the name of the genre is a "" "" commercial entity ' s branding drive "" "". Presumably, he objects strongly to a previously unnoticed form of commercial spam in the Wikipedia article, and a great wrong should be righted by minimizing it. If I correctly understand it, I can only describe this position as extremist. Spacemusic genre is a case of limited circle fame. Its current USA public radio fans are thinly scattered, but dedicated to its support through public radio fund drives. Its niche music sales amount to less than 1% of the commercial market, so very little is written about spacemusic in major USA music publications dependent on commercial advertising. (The rest of the 102 Space music sources to be considered for reclassification as primary, and then removed for synthesis / OR, should be handled separately to avoid noticeboard overload.) I suppose all this would give some reason for caution using in these sources, and particularly a reason to be careful to try to double - source things and to give all sides where sources disagree, but it sounds to me like Hill would be a perfectly reasonable source. Where he is writing about his own work in fostering the genre, or about his own show, he ' s primary. Where he ' s writing about the musicians in the genre, it would seem to me that he is secondary, just like any music critic. - | Talk I agree with on all three points - multiple sources are always recommended when there are differing published views on a topic. On the primary / secondary question - Hill would be a primary source when writing about himself and his own radio show. On third - party topics such as music styles, record albums, musicians, the radio and music business, etc, he ' d be a secondary source. I ' d say that within his area of expertise, there ' s no reason not to use his work as a reliable source. Just to be clear about the encyclopedia - margins deletionist effect of what you are both saying: Stephen Hill and his Hearts of Space website were previously treated as expert - based secondary sources via WP: V (WP: SPS ). The Wikipedia art / music reasoning has previously been that the founder of an art / music genre knows subjectively more about what he / she created than anyone else as a matter of expert opinion. You are changing that. What a secondary source says can be combined in a point - by - point source - provable editorial analysis. In this case, since there are so few other mainstream sources, many or most of them are presently combined with Hill ' s previous secondary expertise source to write the article. But a primary source has fewer rights in an article than a secondary source. What a primary source says cannot be combined with other sources for a standard article editorial analysis, even if every point made by article editors can be proved through analysis of t",NOT

"Mathematicians hired to monitor transactions I removed the following part of the article: Business. dk reported the that bank has a of team mathematicians employed to surveil the clients ' trading patterns. Saxo Bank is not doing anything untraditional in employing mathematicians, since indeed most larger financial institutions employ a number of mathematicians, economists and even physicists. To a lay reader this may sound incriminating or disturbing, but the main task of these employees is in fact to improve the trading systems performance in relation to speed and pricing, and safety in relation to sniping and other unauthorized activity. Furthermore, the secret source in the business. dk article referenced claims that Saxo employs these mathematicians to monitor individual trading patterns (in order to take unfair advantage of customers ). However, and this is not stated in the business. dk article: Saxo shows the same two - sided price, for the same amount, at the same time, to any and all clients trading. This means that no single clients trading pattern is of interest. Therefore the accusation in the business. dk article is not only wrong, but also shows the lack of insight from the secret source and the journalist who wrote it. The fact that an article was brought in an online newspaper does not excuse wrong information. In relation to this particular statement regarding the role of the employed mathematicians, therefore, the article is in my opinion an unreliable source, in with accordance the Wikipedia principles of WP: IRS Either this information regarding the widespread use of mathematicians among larger financial institutions, and regarding Saxo showing the two - sided price etc. should be included, (which I originally did until it was removed) to clarify to the lay reader that this is not uncommon or suspicious, and correct the mistaken information in the business. dk article, or the information about employing mathematicians should be left out completely, to preserve the neutrality of the article.",NOT

""" Naming convention violation part # 3 (Tiderolls) The guideline Wikipedia: Naming conventions (use English ), under the section heading Including alternatives, states that "" "" The body of each article, preferably in its first paragraph, should list all common names by which its subject is widely known. "" "" The first sentence of that guideline states "" "" The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language, as you would find it in reliable sources "" "". .. (My emphasis ). (NCDane) I read the naming convention before my previous message to you, and I considered Naming convention citations I originally provded to to constitute superseding, prima facie authority. I think they are worth repeating, and I will repeat them: German proper names should be treated with care, and attention to English practice The title of an article should generally use the version of the name of the subject which is most common in the English language ' ' ' ' (TR) That means an editor must support their position by providing sources that show a common English usage. (NCD) That is ridiculous because the article ' s previous authors did not provide citation, and the burden should be on them because they were the ones using a letter which does not exist in the English alphabet. Furthermore, you know as well as I do that ~ B is not common English usage: I am sure you, like me, have NEVER in your life seen it used in ANY English - language publication EXCEPT for Wikipedia, and perhaps the Internet Wiki copycats. But since I am up against unreasonable legalism on this issue, here is the first page of Google ENGLISH LANGUAGE BOOK hits on the name “ Hoeness Uli ”: http: / / books. google. com / books? id = rQfNyLM5svIC & pg; = PA200 & dq; = uli + hoeness & hl; = en & ei; = 17IPTYvdG8GB8gat5t3lDQ & sa; = X & oi; = book_result & ct; = result & resnum; = 1 & ved; = 0CCMQ6AEwAA # v = onepage & q; = uli% 20hoeness & f; = false http: / / books. google. com / books? id = rQfNyLM5svIC & pg; = PA200 & dq; = uli + hoeness & hl; = en & ei; = DrMPTdTaL4L98Abrkv2WDg & sa; = X & oi; = book_result & ct; = result & resnum; = 2 & ved; = 0CDEQ6AEwAQ http: / / books. google. com / books? id = x4m5uSd692QC & pg; = PA101 & dq; = uli + hoeness & hl; = en & ei; = DrMPTdTaL4L98Abrkv2WDg & sa; = X & oi; = book_result & ct; = result & resnum; = 6 & ved; = 0CEYQ6AEwBQ http: / / books. google. com / books? id = OsTeLLAo6CkC & pg; = PA225 & dq; = uli + hoeness & hl; = en & ei; = DrMPTdTaL4L98Abrkv2WDg & sa; = X & oi; = book_result & ct; = result & resnum; = 9 & ved; = 0CFMQ6AEwCA As you can see “ Hoeness ” is the version used. I also googled the next five pages and can confirm no use of ~ B by any other English book source.

WHERE DID I EVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT NAKHICHEVAN POPULATION IN 1830s, do you see me ever contesting those statistics? Do you even see me contesting 14th century material? Besides, Nakhichevan discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don ' t get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150, 000, it was its most important period, the after 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided. For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia (Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi ' i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250, 000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah ' Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah ' Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of ' Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran ' s trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44 Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13, 000 families in the silk - growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian. (Source: The Armenians and the East India Company in Persia in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries by R. W. Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973 ), p. 39) Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah ' Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599 - 1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987 ), pp. 68 - 74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars. Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah ' s Silk for Europe ' s Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530 - 1750 ), I don ' t see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan. Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars. Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation. In 1603 Shah ' Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy in conquest the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah ' s capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth - century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new. ..

In fact, while I was FCC - less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, is which kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time a in while, and saw that there ' d been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping. Yes, I ' d say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform - ish. I ' d lean linking toward all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn ' t suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn ' t have a page. That said, that ' s just my opinion - it ' s a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think. It ' d be a big chunk of work to implement if links end up having to be added, although it ' s the kind of gnoming that ' s right up my alley, as you know.> )",NOT

User: Adam Carr ' s proposal: I agree that the above list of statements on this issue does not constitute a vote, and I don ' t think Jtdrl claimed that it was a vote.

The vote should between be two policy positions, one written by and Skyring anyone who agrees with him, and the other written by those who disagree with him. My proposed policy position is this: That in Government of Australia, and in all other articles dealing with Australia ' s system of government, it should be stated that: 1. Australia is a constitutional monarchy and a federal parliamentary democracy 2. Australia ' s head of state is Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia 3. Under the Constitution, almost of all the Queen ' s functions are delegated to and exercised by the Governor - General, as the Queen ' s representative. That any edit which states that (a) Australia is a republic, (b) the Governor - General is Australia ' s head of state, or (c) Australia has more than one head of state, will be reverted, and that such reversions should not be subject to the three - reversions rule. Edits which say that named and relevant persons (eg politicians, constitutional lawyers, judges) disagree with the above position, and which quote those persons at reasonable length, are acceptable, provided proper citation is provided and the three factual statements are not removed.

Earth. 1. a. … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell. Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural. Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue ). These two expressions are good idiomatic English: “ If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear ]. ” “ If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear ]. ” Here the singular “ sky ” and “ heaven ” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English. So we have a choice of eight ‘ very good ’ literal translations: “ YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] skies tremble. ” “ YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble. ” If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best: A. “ YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble. ” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto. The present - progressive clause “ YPG is walking ” would naturally correlate with the present - progressive clause “ the earth and skies are trembling. ” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause. (See above.) To do so, a native English speaker would begin with YPG “ goes walking … ”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

"This "" is the text i struggle to post in G. 91 page. Just to realize how i want to contribute to wiki, and how someone don ' t want i do it: The Aeritalia G. 91, also known as the Fiat G. 91 and nicknamed Gina, was an light Italian fighter aircraft that was intended to serve as standard equipment for NATO air forces in the 1960s. It was eventually only adopted by three - the Italian Air Force, West Germany ' s Luftwaffe, and the Portuguese Air Force, but enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years. Development In 1953, European aircraft manufacturers were invited by NATO to submit aircraft for evaluation for the Light Weight Strike Fighter (LWSF) role. The G. 91 was designed to the specification by the famous Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the "" "" G "" "" designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: the first was the nuclear threat and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft. The technical requirements were: 1, 100 m take - off distance over a 15 m obstacle Capability to operate from grass strips and streets Max speed of 0. 95 Mach Range of 280 km with 10 min over the target Armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks 4x12. 7 mm or 2x20 mm or 30 mm guns A maximum of 2, 200 kg empty weight and 4, 700 kg max weightFerrari 1992, p. 83. The challengher proposals must had been presented within two months after the request. The projecting work was only apparently an easy task, because making a very small aircraft yet capable to cover these NATO specifications was difficult. Fiat Aviazione presented G. 91 and so did other competitors with a total of 10 projects, analysed since 18 March by AGARD (Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development ), led by Theodore Von Karman. The finalists were declared Breguet Taon, Dassault Etendard, Fiat G. 91 and Folland Gnat. Another interesting project was Sud Badoleur Aviation, that solved drastically the problem of a proper landing undercarriage, simply omitted and sobstitued with a landing and take off skid (aircraft was moved in ground operations with a special trailer ). This, however, was not ufficially presented to AGARD, that choose, on paper, the Taon as winner. In the meanwhile, there was the problem of the engine, that must been light yet enough powerful and reliable, with easy and cheap maintenance, like the whole aircraft. The solution was realized by Bristol with the Bristol Orpheus, a simple and effective turbojet It. was adopted to all the finalists, so Bristol will won the contest in every case. G. 91R, presented by Fiat, was also called ' little Sabre '. It was due by the knowledge gained with license - production of a modern aircraft, the F - 86K, that helped to make much experience with advanced jet aircrafts, . It was similar to F - 86 as overall design, but smaller and capable to operate from semi - prepared airstrips. G. 91R was 20% heavier than the estimates and this was due partly to testing hardware, but it was powered by a Bristol Orpheus B. Or 801, 1, 800 kg / t. It was yet capable to supersonic speed in dives, as shown by the flight made in 20 February 1957 when it was able to break the sound barrier four times with 9, 000 m dives. His test pilot Riccardo Bignamini, a famous one of that times (he won McKenna Trophy at Empire Test School) was a key element to solve the G. 91 shortcomings and the first flight was made in 9 August 1956 at Torino - Caselle airfield. Few days after it was tested at high speed and at 1, 300 m ceiling, but lost control and Bignamini w",NOT

Posted 9 / 12 / 2006 9: 40 PM ET Internet types love sweeping ideas that come in the form of book titles that morph into catchphrases that can be dropped like little bombs into conversations to show how smart they are. "" "" Well, you know, his company was vulnerable to The Innovator ' s Dilemma, especially because he didn ' t have a World Is Flat strategy, although he could ' ve seen it coming if he ' d tapped into a Wisdom of Crowds approach. "" "" This is at its most grating when said with a Thurston Howell III accent. Anyway, the concept of "" "" the wisdom of crowds "" "" — the title of a popular 2004 book James by Surowiecki — is particularly hot among tech companies right now. Yet in the past week, the concept run has into a couple of potholes. One is a rhubarb at Internet darling Digg. com; the other, the U. K. government ' s case of the hijacked wiki. Both have people wondering if crowds are really all that wise, and what conditions have to exist to make them wise. Why is it that some crowds seem smart, while others turn into ugly mobs? At its most basic level, the wisdom of crowds — let ' s call it WOC, so I don ' t have to type as much — means that the aggregated thought and knowledge of thousands or millions of people can be smarter than trained individual experts. The WOC has been around forever — it ' s what democratic elections try to tap into. But the Net takes it to a whole new level. "" "" The Internet provides a mechanism to get lots of diverse opinions and aggregate it in a quick and cost - effective way, "" "" Surowiecki tells me. So if a company can use the Net to tap the collected intelligence of its employees, the employees will make better decisions than the CEO. IBM, Google and others have tried this. Wikipedia, written and edited by tens of thousands of unpaid contributors, should be better than an encyclopedia written and edited by specialists. News sites such as Digg, which lets users vote stories to the front page, should surface the best stuff more effectively than professional editors. Except it doesn ' t always work that way. Pointing specifically at Wikipedia, Lauren Weinstein of the People for Internet Responsibility says that the Net has propagated a "" "" basic fallacy that a wisdom - of - crowds approach could ever work, even theoretically. "" "" Which might be extreme. But clearly some of the WOC mechanisms in use today have shortcomings. Take Digg. Founder Kevin Rose set it up with a simple premise: If you like a news item or blog post, you can "" "" digg "" "" it by voting for it. Items with the most votes move to the front of the home page. But cabals of users started working together to boost certain items. Digg became less about the WOC and more about the ambitions of 1, 000 or so savvy members. So last week, Rose changed the formula. Digg will use computer programs to try to devalue bloc voting and give more value to what appears to be independent thinking. Digg ' s regulars revolted, causing a big Web stink. But Surowiecki thinks the site will now be better. "" "" The thing that makes the wisdom of crowds work is lots of diverse opinions and independent judgments, "" "" Surowiecki says. "" "" Digg acknowledged it wanted more diversity of input. "" "" So WOC needs the right structure to work, something the U. K. ' s Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) found out the hard way. DEFRA decided to let the public help it write environmental contracts, so it posted one on the Net as a wiki. The idea of a wiki — such as Wikipedia — is that anyone can log on and add or change something. In the case of DEFRA ' s wiki the, public mutilated it. In one of the more printable alterations, someone changed "" "" Who are the parties to the environmental contract "" "" to "" "" Where is the party for the environmental contract? Can I come? Will there be cake? Hooray! "" "" "" "" These sorts of issues have permeated the Net, "" "" Weinstein says. "" "" Part of the problem is. .. it doesn ' t take a lot of people to cause such disruptions. "" "" Wikis, as it turns out, are not so much tapping the WOC as they are works in constant progress. Depending on who last wrote something, at any one time the wiki might be good, or bad. Despite hiccups, though, there ' s still a lot of enthusiasm for WOC. Google, in its own way, is a WOC device. It analyzes links that millions of people put on websites to come up with the most relevant search results. The reputation system on eBay uses WOC to self - police its users.

""" First of all, congratulations on the Good Article status. Nice work. Since you don ' t object, I have added that section back to Little Boy. That action should not affect its good article status. Here is my reasoning. That particular bomb design is uniquely associated with the Hiroshima bombing, which, turn in, was largely a public weapon effects demonstration. Its purpose was to show that a single bomb could duplicate the effects of, say, the Tokyo firebombing which required 279 airplanes and 1, 700 tons of bombs. Hiroshima was spared any earlier bombing in order to serve as a pristine nuclear bomb target, a situation made possible by its lack of importance as a military target. The two airplanes that accompanied Enola Gay were there to measure the weapon effects. Nobody expected the loss of Hiroshima to tip the balance in favor of immediate surrender. The "" "" shock and awe "" "" was expected to come from observing that it was effect of a single bomb. Most of we what know about nuclear weapon effects comes from an intensive study of Hiroshima. It was flat urban terrain well protected by natural and artificial firebreaks, and it was enough larger than the total destruction area that the margins of the effects could be precisely measured. Nothing new was learned from Nagasaki, and no other bombs were tested live on urban targets. In the many test explosions that followed, large and small, the overpressure and thermal impulse contours were measured, and the Hiroshima effects were extrapolated to estimate the theoretical destruction area. Granted, it was pure happenstance that Little Boy, and not Fat Man, was used at Hiroshima, but since it was this discussion of weapon effects seems appropriate here. """,NOT

""" Request opinion of Muslim editor Hello. Could you please stop by Talk: Christianity and give your opinion? We are debating whether the word ' monotheism ' should be included in the intro to the Christianity article. According to most dictionaries, the definition of monotheism is The dogma or belief that there is one God. Now, all Christians believe there is God one and all Christian creeds (such as the Nicene Creed and Chalcedonian Creed) profess a belief in one God. The point of contention is the Holy Trinity. Christians believe that God the Father, God the Son (Jesus ), and God the Holy Spirit all make up one [[ Ousia | essense] of God, i. e. are three parts of one God (known as hypostasis ). Now, several editors think that because this is different from the Islamic view of Tawhidand they alledge Muslims think Christians are not monotheistic, but [[ tritheistic] we cannot say Christianity is monotheistic like is done in the Islam article. Many editors content, however, that the definition of monotheism is based solely on belief, not truth. So if Christians believe their God is one God, are they by definition monotheistic, even if they may not be right. All it takes to be monotheistic is to believe there is one God. Others, however, think we can only say "" "" Christianity is a monotheistic religion according to its followers. "" "" Again, some editors (including myself) have issue with this because it ' s basically like saying "" "" Christianity believes it believes that there is one God, "" "" which of course is redundant. In my opinion, monotheism by definition is the belief! None - the - less, we would like to know from a Muslim editor: 1) Do Muslims view Christianity as tritheistic? 2) If so, does this view affect that fact that Christians think their God is one God (even though they may not be right ), and if not, aren ' t Christians by definition monotheistic?

""" You can ' t have it both ways. You ' re either an encyclopedic website that seeks to be factual and informative while minimizing speculation or you ' re a fansite.

For example, if your site is a community run information site, then it should not be included under the In general, any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article here would have once it becomes an example of brilliant prose guideline. Your Wiki won ' t provide information we don ' t already have or will have in the future if its just a community info site. However, if it trades in information that we won ' t be adding, such as speculation, theories, spoilers, because of Wikipedia guidelines on such material, then we should not be posting your sites for the reasons discussed above. It is not the case of making a link between encyclopedias, but between an encyclopedia and one particular fansite. Further, the two Wikis you mention aren ' t even major fansites, when the guideline specifically states: Fan sites: On articles about topics with many fansites, including a link to one major fansite is appropriate, marking the link as such. In extreme cases, a link to a web directory of fansites can replace this link. We already have the major AND official forum: The Fuselage. If you ' d like to add a link to a directory of Lost fansites, be my guest. .. but inclusion of either Wiki alone (instead of a list) is preferential treatment of minor fansites, since there are certainly other, larger, more popular fansites (Lost - media, Lost - tv, for example ). Certainly, if we were to start adding fansites at random, we ' d have to begin there and with others, like a link to TWOP ' s reviews and forums. The best course of action if you believe these sites simply must be linked to is for you to make list a of fansites and include a link to that directory, which is how WP: EL says to proceed. As for removing the disclaimer, its not going anywhere. The disclaimer was put there specifically because we ' d have people posting each and every fansite they dreamed up as official sites when they weren ' t. Lost is an example of a show wherein Wikipedia guidelines and policies are repeatedly ignored by the editing community, so the long - term editors have had to be very diligent in monitoring this page. This is an outgrowth of that, and has for the most part helped a lot. Moreover, there is no "" "" freebie "" "" section for links. All links listed there are official sources except IMDB, which is used almost without exception.

Connolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world ever has known – Wikipedia. Starting in February, 2003. .. Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia ’ s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug. 11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world ’ s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period. All told, Connolley created or rewrote 5, 428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn ’ t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2, 000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions … In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.

""" Orbit of the Moon So apparently there are some sources that describe the Moon ' s orbit as, convex and some that describe it as concave.

And the Wikipedia article Convex and concave polygons seems to imply that a circle without loops would be convex, rather than concave.

Convexity and concavity have no distinction with respect to inwards or outwards.

Marder is interesting because in his twenties he was possibly the last person to look at a great deal of Admiralty literature.

A quick look at the official All Blacks site shows numerous players who have played several matches for the All Blacks but have never played for the New Zealand national team in an international match. As the 2 names are not exactly equivalent, I have to agree with GordyB and Duncharris that strictly speaking we should not use All Blacks as the main name for this article. 13: 13, 4 September """,NOT

My response contained words and statements that were correctly and appropriately describing (with civil English words) the FACTS in relation to nature of his personal attacks on me.

I contend that your obviously biased behavior should preclude you from further involvement in any "" "" moral code violation "" "" disciplinary action, let alone this specific one. This is for starters in addressing your negative comments about me. I hope I have I made this point clear to YOU now!
