# GeneralOffense - Generalising Offensive Language Indeitification
Most available offensive language identification datasets are often not directly comparable as they have been annotated using different guidelines aiming at different abusive language identification sub-tasks (e.g. hate speech, cyberbulling, toxicity,). Furthermore, they often contain data retrieved from various platforms (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Gab, and Reddit) using different criteria (e.g. keywords).
In this project, we find various generalisable patterns in different offensive language identification datasets.
